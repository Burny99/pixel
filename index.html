            Norway
        </h4>
        <p6>This natural phenomenon -- 24 hours of visible sun -- occurs during the summer in northern Norway, which sits above the Arctic Circle. Not only is the midnight sun an incredible sight, it leaves more hours in the day for fishing, boating, climbing and explore.
        While Finland has more than 60,000 lakes, Norway surpasses it. There are hundreds of thousands of lakes in Norway and they're really beautiful.Stryn Summer Ski Center opens in late May and welcomes skiiers through late July or mid-August depending on the snow conditions. If you get a hankering for skiing during the warm months, you know where to go.Allemannsrett literally translates to "all men's rights." It's a "freedom to roam" public rights law that allows the right of access to and passage through all uncultivated land. This means you can pitch a tent or hike through any land that is "utmark" (non-cultivated). Also, wild-berrying is permitted everywhere. This little rule is extra awesome because there tons of jaw-droppingly beautiful places to see in Norway and few barriers stopping you.</p6>

            Alaska
        </h4>
        <p6>Ahh, Alaska! The beautiful state of America surrounded by rugged scenery, vast landscape and an abundance of wildlife.

Situated in the north-west extremity of North America, Alaska is strangely distant from the rest of the USA. The only land border of this American state actually backs on to Yukon, the territory of Canada; strange right?

To be honest, this state of USA is far more like Canada than the rest of its own nation – for the most part anyway. Contrary to a lot of America’s mainland, Alaska is incredibly untouched and undisturbed by man. A place that makes me incredibly happy, and also incredibly sad – but we’ll get into that later! As many foreigners like to think – “Alaska… there’s nothing there, right?” – Wrong!

Well, they’re partially right I suppose; there’s certainly no luxury shopping, 5* dining or busy city lifestyles, that’s for sure. But for those who love nature, Alaska really is the one stop shop!

The surroundings are far beyond any nature experience that I’ve ever encountered; enormous glacier bays, extreme wildlife populations, beautiful scenery and an extravagant amount of natural wonders are at almost every turn.</p6>

            South Africa
        </h2>
        <p2>Most of the country is situated on a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains extending from the escarpment to the sea. On the east coast the Indian Ocean, the southward-flowing warm Mozambique Current brings dependable rain to the coastal plains. So South Africa has lush forests and bushveld on the east coast and along the escarpment. Once on the central plateau, the rainfall decreases steadily towards the west until, on the west coast, South Africa has semi-desert conditions.

The Atlantic Ocean on this coast is cooled by the Benguela Current, which flows northwards from the Antarctic and so does not bring much rain. But it is one of the richest sources of fishing in the world. Right in the southwest corner of the country, the Western Cape is somewhat anomalous. Rainfall here is in winter and is brought by huge cyclonic weather systems. The summers are warm and dry and, generally the whole floral and faunal assemblage is unique.</p2>

            America
        </h2>
        <p2>The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

The Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas, a Roman liberty goddess. She holds a torch above her head with her right hand, and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI" (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad.

Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and U.S. peoples.  </p2>

            Christianity
        </h2>
        <p2>Christianity, like other religions, has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary. Christianity regards the biblical canon, the Old Testament and the New Testament, as the inspired word of God. The traditional view of inspiration is that God worked through human authors so that what they produced was what God wished to communicate. The Greek word referring to inspiration in 2 Timothy 3:16 is theopneustos, which literally means "God-breathed".

Some believe that divine inspiration makes our present Bibles inerrant. Others claim inerrancy for the Bible in its original manuscripts, although none of those are extant. Still others maintain that only a particular translation is inerrant, such as the King James Version. Another closely related view is Biblical infallibility or limited inerrancy, which affirms that the Bible is free of error as a guide to salvation, but may include errors on matters such as history, geography or science.
